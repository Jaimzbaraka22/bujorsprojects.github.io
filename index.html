										led us to the conclusion that their turning rate was high. The resort was able to decrease turning rates by
										10% thanks to our recommendations. This analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel</p>

									<p>TThe goal of British Airways was to increase customer retention and satisfaction.

										their offerings in these domains. We were able to offer the essential perspectives and recommend
										the necessary next steps. With the help of Microsoft PowerBI and the data that was provided to us,
										we were able to assess and identify areas that needed corrections and attention.</p>

									<p>As a member of the business analyst team, Max Corp was facing difficulties with their shipping and sales operations.
										We wanted to turn the tide on these problems, so we needed to gather insights from their datasets to address them and enhance
										their overall performance. This included identifying their most valuable customers, the product categories from which they made
										the most money, which ones were sold the most, and so on.</p>
